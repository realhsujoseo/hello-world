This was filmed on the New York Street set at Fox Studios in LA. Many TV shows have been filmed there. You can even catch a glimpse of Maclaren’s Pub from How I Met Your Mother at 3:04. You can also see the Royal Diner from Bones just a few frames later. I’m pretty sure both can be seen in an episode of Its Always Sunny as well.

Wish Bruno Mars will have many best songs to dedicate to everyone to enjoy and listen to the memories that have gone into people\\'s hearts, goodbye ( Bài hát đã đi vào huyền thoại, vũ đạo điêu luyện, ca từ cực chất cộng với tiết tấu rất chắc và cực kỳ sôi động khiến ai nghe bài này cũng phải thưởng thức nhiều lần, nhưng ấn tượng nhất vẫn là chủ nhân của ca khúc Uptown Funk - Bruno Mars, chất giọng không thể bắt chước được, vì tôi nghĩ đây là một giọng ca khó cho những ai dự thi chương trình Gương mặt thân quen. Chúc Bruno Mars sẽ có nhiều ca khúc hay nhất để cống hiến cho mọi người cùng thưởng thức và lắng nghe những kỉ niệm đã đi vào lòng người, tạm biệt ).\\nRead more\\nREPLY\\nIf you see me 2 times check my channel and Sub\\n1 month ago\\namazing\\nREPLY\\nA Mandalorian\\n11 months ago\\nBruno Mars is the closest thing we\\'ll get to Michael Jackson\\n7K\\nREPLY\\nView 234 replies\\nももだぞ！\\n3 months ago\\nこの曲ほんとに大好きです\\n2\\nREPLY\\nNauval Akbar\\n9 months ago\\nMichael Jackson in heaven : that’s my boy\\n2.9K\\nREPLY\\nView 65 replies\\nRita Cássia\\n3 months ago\\neu me lembro que quando eu saia da minha casa para qualquer lugar, essa música tocava kkkk \\nEssa foi uma das melhores épocas para mim, tenho saudades!!\\n121\\nREPLY\\nView 6 replies\\n나사렛파오\\n3 months ago\\nAMOOO ESTÁ CANCIÓN 😚💗\\n9\\nREPLY\\nAndrew Jones\\n11 days ago\\nSPLENDID VIDEO 📹 👌\\nREPLY\\nRoopal Singh\\n3 months ago\\nBruno Mars is so in tune with himself that he just doesnt need any other glamour than himself and his friends.

This song was a career defining moment for Bruno Mars. That much is evident. Just look at the music he’s come out with since. The guy is a generational talent. Who could have guessed back in his “Just the Way You Are” days? His songs were always good and his talent was always obvious, but he’s on another planet now. Unorthodox Jukebox certainly caught my attention but this song and everything that has followed? Good god. Sky is the limit for him. He may even be destined for pop music’s Mt. Rushmore.
